# 🧮 Linear Regression GUI App

A sleek, educational desktop app to **train your own Linear Regression model from scratch** — using nothing but Python, Tkinter, and NumPy. Perfect for learning how gradient descent actually works under the hood 🚀
Currently this program only supports csv files so load files accordingly.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Load CSV datasets with ease  
✅ Choose your own target column  
✅ Run training with customizable epochs  
✅ View live training loss updates  
✅ Save model weights and bias automatically  
✅ Experience the retro vibes of a Tkinter interface

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI
- **NumPy** – matrix ops and math magic
- **scikit-learn** – just for scaling (`StandardScaler`)

---

## Models 

- **The Library_model is of the scikit-learn library**
- **The Self_model is made from scratch**
- **For accuracy use Library_model**

---

## Uses 

- **This project can be used by statistics students to perform Linear Regression on data**
- **This project can be used as a learning resource of whats under the hood in ML models**
- **The weights or the coefficient and intercept will be stored in weights/weights.txt**
---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-gui.git
   cd linear-regression-gui



## 🧪 How It Works
- **Enter the path to your CSV file (e.g., data.csv)**

- **Input the name of the target column (e.g., Revenue)**

- **Set the number of training epochs**

- **Hit “Start Training” and watch the magic happen in the console**

- **Model weights will be saved in /weights/weights.txt**

## Example
- **Dataset path**: coffee_shop.csv
- **Target column**: Daily_Revenue
- **Epochs**: 100
